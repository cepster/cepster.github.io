      <description>Despite the internet&amp;rsquo;s best memelords attempts to convince me otherwise, I absolutely love JavaScript and TypeScript. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily the languages themselves that I like, but there&amp;rsquo;s something about how the ecosystem has constructed itself and the design patterns that have emerged that totally jive with me. To that end, whenever I start up a greenfield project that requires an API, I immediately look towards Node/Express rather than doing something more Enterprise-y like a Spring app.</description>

      <description>NestJS is a progressive NodeJS framework that makes it dirt simple to build clean server-side applications. It takes the simple API-building concepts from ExpressJS and adds a structure around it which includes:
 Annotation-based resource definitions Dependency Injection Module resolution Helpful CLI And Much More!  In this talk I will demonstrate a live code walkthrough of building a full MEAN application (Mongo-Express-Node-Angular) from scratch using NestJS.</description>

      <description>MANAGERS: “Put everything in Kubernetes!”
ARCHITECTS: “That’s simple, just use microservices”
DEV-OPS ENGINEERS: “Have you tried a Kubernetes-based polyglot micro services application with Istio service mesh?”
YOU: “Yeah, that’s great. But I have a real job making my company money with a legacy application. I can’t just take two years to re-architect the world. Plus, I’m fairly certain 90% of what you just said is utter nonsense. So why should I care about any of this?</description>
